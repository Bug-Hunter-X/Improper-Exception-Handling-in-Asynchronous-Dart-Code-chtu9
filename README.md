# Dart Asynchronous Programming Bug: Improper Exception Handling

This repository showcases a common error in asynchronous Dart code and provides a solution. The bug involves improper exception handling in an asynchronous function, leading to potential difficulties in debugging and error reporting.  The provided solution demonstrates the best practice of properly handling and rethrowing exceptions to ensure robust error management.

## Bug Description
The original `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from a remote API. However, its exception handling is incomplete. If an exception occurs during the API call or JSON decoding, the error is simply printed, and execution continues, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.  This lack of proper error handling makes debugging and diagnosing issues challenging.

## Solution
The improved code utilizes the `rethrow` keyword to re-throw any caught exceptions. This allows calling functions to handle the exceptions appropriately, improving error management and enabling better debugging practices.
